# SW-MCU-STM32-ExternalRTC-018

I used DS3231 RTC with 0.96 inc screen.

Here is a example for time / date.

It is useful if you have unrealible power source, you can track time even if you lose power for a long time.

You can use and adapt this code to any type of projects that need a RTC Module. Use it wisely.

Hope this helps you,
